Regarding Singletons, Steve Yegge writes:<br /><br /><p></p><blockquote><p> In my Data Structures course in college, when we got to AVL trees, my prof turned and wrote on the board, in huge, clear letters: </p>   <p><span style=";font-size:78%;color:red;"  ><pre> <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">AVL Trees are EVIL</span></pre></span> </p>   <p> ...and that's all we had to learn about them. He had us implement red/black trees and splay trees instead. To this day, I have no idea how threaded AVL trees work. But if that's OK with Dan Weld, it's OK with me. </p>   <p> But now I know how he felt.</p></blockquote><p> </p><br /><br /><span style="font-size:100%;">Steve, Steve. Follow Mr. Weld's example. Or you could just point people toward "Test-Driven Development By Example", since Mr. Beck has already covered this one pretty well:<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><blockquote>"How do you provide global variables in languages without global variables? Don't. Your programs will thank you for taking the time to think about design instead."</blockquote></span></span>
