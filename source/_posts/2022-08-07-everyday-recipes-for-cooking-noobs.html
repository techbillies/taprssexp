  A handful of recipes from the people at nilenso for your reading pleasure.
  These have all been tried by real cooking noobs and are hopefully simple
  enough for anyone to follow along. Having said that, if you do burn your
  cookers don&rsquo;t @ us on twitter or instagram.

  <span class="font-bold">Fun fact:</span> Did you know, almost 47% of the
  people in our country don&rsquo;t know how to cook.

  <h2>Sandy&rsquo;s French toast with stewed apples</h2>
  <div class="grid-col-3" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">
    <div
        id="french-toast-img"

    ></div>
    <div id="french-toast-bullets">
      <div>
        For the toast, you will need
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">
          <li>Eggs</li>
          <li>Milk</li>
          <li>Sugar</li>
          <li>Bread</li>
          <li>Butter, preferably unsalted</li>
          <li>A bit of oil</li>
        </ul>
        Bonus
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px">
          <li>Chocolate sauce</li>
          <li>Cinnamon powder</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style="border-right: 1px dotted black; padding: 0px"></div>
      <div style="padding-left: 0px">
        For the stewed apples
        <ul>
          <li>Apples</li>
          <li>Butter</li>
          <li>Honey</li>
          <li>Sugar</li>
          <li>Water</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <span class="justify">
    <p>
      Break two eggs, add a bit of milk and sugar and mix it up. I use a fork
      for this typically. If you have chocolate sauce you could add it to this
      batter directly, cinnamon also. You'll dip the bread into the batter and
      then fry it on the pan, so make sure the bread fits into whatever it is
      you're using to make the batter in. I usually break the eggs into another
      pan or a walled plate. In my experience, two eggs is usually enough for
      six slices of bread, which serves two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, put a pan on the gas. Add a tiny amount of oil, it's just to prevent
      sticking and prevent the butter from burning. Put a bit of butter on the
      pan. Then take a slice of bread, dip both sides into the batter, let the
      excess batter run off and then fry the bread. Be sure to do both sides.
      Repeat until you run out of batter. Try not to overcook the toast, I think
      it's nicer when soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could eat the French toast with jam or something if you want, or you
      could make the apples like I'm about to tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slice up an apple into bite sized chunks. Lightly dust the bottom of a
      vessel with sugar and melt it. Be very careful, if you heat the sugar too
      long it'll burn, and if you let the sugar cool off it'll stick to the
      vessel and become a real pain in the ass. No pressure. Add the apples in
      at this point along with some butter, mix it up nicely. I've also added
      honey in at this point as well, that's quite nice. Then add a bit of
      water. The apples should be partly submerged. Let them simmer on the
      stove. You want the water to evaporate.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll be left with the apples and some very sweet sauce as well. Usually
      I prepare the apples in the vessel, let them simmer and then start with
      the toast. They'll get done together.
    </p>
    <p>Put the apples and sauce over the French toast and enjoy.</p>

  <h2>Atharva&rsquo;s Optimal Scrambled Eggs</h2>
  <div class="grid-col-2">
    <div class="flip-order">
      Good scrambled eggs are all about that texture. It should be smooth and
      creamy like a custard, with chunky and gooey curds. You need:
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Either corn starch or patience</li>
      </ul>
      <span>Recipe</span>
      <span class="justify">
        <ul>
          <li>Whisk eggs nicely and salt them.</li>
          <li>
            Optional: add cold butter chunklets which create cool localized
            pockets while the eggs cook, which adds more variation to the
            texture.<sup></sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have cornstarch, make a bit of slurry and whisk it into the
            eggs. If you don&rsquo;t have cornstarch, you need patience for the
            same result (explained later).
          </li>
          <li>Put some fat on your pan, butter prolly</li>
          <li>Once your butter is foamy, but not brown, put in the eggs</li>
          <li>
            Now keep stirring it. If you have cornstarch added, the eggs
            won&rsquo;t tighten up and become rubbery that easily, so you can
            take it chill. But if you didn&rsquo;t add cornstarch, do not let
            those eggs sit on the pan for a second. KEEP STIRRING IT LIKE A
            LUNATIC.
          </li>
          <li>Now for the people who opted for patience:</li>
          <li>
            Keep stirring it and do not keep it on high heat. As soon as you
            feel like the eggs are slowly starting to solidify, turn off the
            heat and take off the pan and keep stirring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rinse and repeat this, depending on how many eggs you are cooking,
            this may take even 10 mins.
          </li>
        </ul>

        your whole life. It&rsquo;s really that good.&rdquo;

      You&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s done once you get this thick, creamy, chunky
      texture. And stop the heat before you think it&rsquo;s ready. The egg will
      continue to cook in its heat. I only learned too late about the cornstarch
      shortcut. The main concept is that you gotta let your eggs cook really
      slow. Basically, torture the eggs and make them almost solidify but not
      quite every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eat it with some mildly toasted rustic bread. Wheat bread also works. If
      you are feeling fancy a thick hunk of sourdough would be perfect.
