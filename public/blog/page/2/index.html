  <div class="entry-content"><p>*Deliberately sensationalist headline designed to grab eyeballs.</p>


<p>We recently concluded annual reviews at <a href="http://nilenso.com">nilenso</a>, at the end of which, Sandy, who recently joined us, asked: “Why is our process the best we can have?”</p>


<p>This led to a lot of reminiscing about how reviews were conducted at other companies that some of us had worked at.</p>


<p>One example went like this: I ask people to review me. I don’t get to read what they said, or find out if they even bothered to write anything at all. Someone from my team (a senior, usually my boss) would look at all these reports along with HR, and hold a meeting with me. The meeting basically involved my boss giving me a summary of the above, based on his/her understanding/interpretation. While I could ask for explanations and examples when I received feedback that I couldn’t relate to, they were not always forthcoming.</p>


<p>There <em>was</em> in fact a level system based on which variable pay was decided, but this was not disclosed. Since the bonuses were kept confidential, even if a person did find out what someone else made, they couldn’t question their pay relative to their colleague (maybe s/he is a better negotiator?).** There was no incremental movement between levels. Post x number of years, you either moved up or out.</p>


<p>Another colleague said that reviews at his previous organisation involved filling out a report, mentioning the number of bugs you had fixed (or caused), SLAs you had met (or missed), and so on, and that “regardless of all this, your appraisal merely depended on the ‘relationship’ you had developed with your manager. Nothing really came about even when you rejected whatever level the manager gave you, because in the end s/he decides it.”</p>


<p>While these may sound like extreme cases, they are very real (and not all that uncommon). Regardless of experience, the adjectives thrown around to describe the performance management process ranged from “random” and “unfair” to “opaque” and “senseless”.</p>


<p>We’ve <a href="https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2015/06/30/how-to-co-op-salaries-reviews/">written</a> about how we conduct reviews before, but here’s a quick recap.</p>


<ul><li>We use an <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/reviews">app</a> (hey, we’re a tech company!) to write reviews for each other. This is open source, if you’d like to use it, be our guest.</li><li>The reviews written are visible to everyone within nilenso.</li><li>Once this is done (and we stress that reviews should summarise feedback that has <em>already been given during the course of the year)</em> and a “level” has been suggested, we collectively sit down to discuss, and finalise compensation for the coming year.</li></ul>


<p>Stacey Adams’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_theory">equity theory</a>, that describes how individuals perceive the distribution of resources is well documented. In order to apply this concept, however, and to determine whether one’s compensation is fair, what one needs is data on how the available resources (profits) were distributed to begin with. The approach that most organisations take in this regard is to hold back information relevant to employees. We run against that grain here.</p>


<p>I don’t claim that our method is perfect. In fact, it’s constantly being tweaked. I would posit, however, that the fact that the rationale behind it is completely transparent, and open to critique, makes it better than a system which keeps hidden from its participants, the thought that went into creating it.</p>


<p>I’m also not going to pretend that this will work for everyone. More specifically, I’ll admit that this process may not scale well, and beyond a point, will have to be adapted it to suit the needs of a company that employs hundreds, as opposed to tens of people.</p>


<p>In the meantime, I’ll leave you with this quote by JFK:</p>


<blockquote>“We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.”</blockquote>


<p>**We would write down our bonuses on a piece of paper, throw them in a hat, and then read them out loud. This way, everyone knew where s/he stood, but no one knew who got what.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Inspired by a recent(ish)* Basecamp <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/employee-benefits-at-basecamp-d2d46fd06c58#.o4hfovwma">article</a> on the benefits they offer their employees; we decided to evaluate our own to see how we stack up. Not too badly, as it turns out. We’ve also (mostly) used their format. I hope they won’t mind, given what they say about imitation and flattery.</p>


<h4>Nilenso Benefits</h4>


<p><strong>Salaries: </strong>We are currently based out of Bangalore, India and it’s always a terrible idea to evaluate anything here on the basis of “averages”. We do, however, try to pay competitively but also never forget that just money is simply not enough.</p>


<p><strong>Transparent finances: </strong>We pride ourselves on being a completely open company, in every way. Everyone at nilenso collectively decides which projects we take on, and what our expenses for the year should be. We go out of our way to make sure everyone in the company understands how much money we’re making and how we’re spending it. Our books of accounts and finances are available for anyone within the company to take a look, at any time. If something’s confusing, just ask.</p>


<p><strong>Open reviews: </strong>Our review meetings that happen twice a year are completely open too, to anyone who wants to attend them. Everyone can read the reviews written by everyone else, and they’re all open to questioning.</p>


<p>Read more about our review / salary structure <a href="http://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2015/06/30/how-to-co-op-salaries-reviews/">here</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Insurance: </strong>Medical care is expensive, so all our employees and their family — parents, children and spouses are covered by a comprehensive insurance policy (this means cashless, all ailments covered, pre-existing conditions included, no bureaucracy policy), where nilenso pays 100% of the premium.</p>


<p><strong>Education allowance: </strong>While we don’t have a formal limit on what you can spend on education, employees are free to use the company credit card to buy books — technical or otherwise as well as pay for courses online or offline. We even have an English tutor who comes in every week to help our Operations staff improve their language skills. One of them is now giving his board examinations, after being out of school for more than a decade.<br>We also try to host educational events at the office — from Haskell lessons to technical talks (if you haven’t been to XTC — eXtreme Tuesday’s Club, ask us for an invite). We want you to attend conferences, whether that’s around the block or halfway around the world. Since we’ve been up and running, we’ve attended a ton of conferences: Euroclojure, Clojure/West, Clojure/conj, RubyConf San Diego, RubyConf India, React Conf SF, StrangeLoop, GCRC, Fifth Elephant, JSFoo, rootconf, pgconf, 50p — and that’s not an exhaustive list.</p>


<p><strong>100% coverage on hardware / software: </strong>Whatever hardware, software, or services you need to do your job are always 100% on us. No red tape, no questions asked.</p>


<p><strong>Ergonomic Furniture: </strong>If you’re not comfortable in the office, we’re not happy. If your desk is too high, or the lighting in your room is too bright, let us know, and we’ll do something about it.</p>


<p><strong>Expense Account: </strong>Everyone who works at nilenso has access to our debit and credit cards to pay for any work-related expenses — software, hardware, travel, office supplies, books. If you’ve paid for something from your own pocket, that’s fine too! Just send us a photo of the receipt and we’ll reimburse it promptly (we have an app called <a href="https://www.kulu.in/">kulu</a> that keeps track of all of this). When you’re traveling abroad, we get you a prepaid forex card, so you don’t have to pay for anything expensive yourself. Basically, everything goes, as long as you’re reasonable (nobody has been unreasonable so far).</p>


<p><strong>Fully stocked healthy pantry: </strong>Our pantry is restocked daily with fresh fruits, yoga bars, and healthy alternatives to aerated soft drinks (just put whatever you’d like on the list we have put up, and it shall magically appear in the kitchen). We also make sure there’s fresh milk, bread and cereal, for the days when you miss breakfast.</p>


<p><strong>Lunches: </strong>We get lunch in the office everyday and eat out once a week (admittedly, this could be somewhat healthier than it is now — we order in, based on what people like, but we’re working on it).</p>


<p><strong>Menstruation Leave : </strong>nilenso offers paid menstrual leave for anyone who needs it, no questions asked.</p>


<p><strong>Vacations and Paid Holidays: </strong>nilenso offers 29 days of paid vacation and a few national holidays. Obviously, this doesn’t include times when you’re very ill — and when you are, we’d like you to take as much time as you need to recuperate before getting back to work. None of this is strictly monitored, so we’re often asked what happens if people take advantage of our liberal vacation policy. For the record, we don’t know, because it hasn’t happened.</p>


<p><strong>Maternity and Paternity Leave: </strong>At nilenso, both parents are offered 6 months paid and a further 6 months unpaid leave around the time that they welcome a newborn.</p>


<p><strong>Work: </strong>Being a technology company, we’re really passionate about deep tech, but also about education, healthcare, maps, renewable energy and a host of other subjects. The first couple of years of our journey at nilenso were spent trying to establish ourselves as a firm that could be counted on to deliver on technically challenging projects. Having done that, we’re now fortuitously positioned to use technology to solve real world problems. While this isn’t technically a benefit, we actively try to find projects that align with your interests, even if it comes at a cost.</p>


<p><strong>Working weeks: </strong>We’re a small company, so people often end up doing way more than they would in other, larger firms — recruiting, sales calls, ordering lunch, talking to lawyers, taking Haskell lessons. We encourage 40-hour working weeks, and let our clients know what to expect as well.</p>


<p><strong>Working remotely: </strong>Many ensonians often work from home (some more often than others). Some time last year, Tim even worked from a beachside getaway in Kerala for a couple of weeks. If there’s any way we can support you while you’re away, we do it. We use Slack / email as much as possible so you’re connected to everything going on at work. Alternatively, if you need a data dongle because there’s no WiFi where you’re going, pick one up from the office. None of our employees are fully remote, so we’re not there yet, but we’re definitely on our way.</p>


<p>It’s never easy to pen down what a company does for its employees, because it’s so difficult to separate that from what it does for itself. In our case though, there’s no need for separation: as a <a href="http://blog.deobald.ca/2014/11/huh-software-cooperative.html">co-op</a>, the company *is* its employees, and everyone who works here owns her just as much as the next person.</p>


<p>— — — — — <br>*Okay, I admit it, I wrote this post in January 2016 and then sat on it for a year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">PMS. I still can't remember first learning about Pre-Menstrual Symptoms as a child. I don't remember the specific event, but the understanding conveyed. I imagine it went something like this: "My Mom was really grouchy this morning." - "Oh, she probably has PMS." - "Is that a disease?" - "Nah, it's something that happens to Moms once a month. They get really grouchy and you should just leave them alone."</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">My teen years didn't do much to broaden my understanding. It was eventually apparent that menstruation affected all women&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #545454; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small; line-height: 18.2px;">—</span><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">&nbsp;not just Moms&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #545454; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small; line-height: 18.2px;">—</span><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">&nbsp;and that the process began just as my own pre-teen body was thrown into fits and starts of its own. I learned the basics of female anatomy from Health class and Sex Ed, but even as a young adult, I mentally associated menstruation with violent and seemingly illogical mood swings. I began to see it as a physiological phenomenon and the cause of complex mental/physical interactions not clearly understood by either those affected or the field of neuroscience. As with so many other subjects, I didn't really learn the&nbsp;</span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 25.6px;">true</em><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">&nbsp;basics of menstruation and female anatomy until I observed them first-hand. Direct experience (or, in this case, as direct experience as is possible for males) always trumps even the deepest theoretical and intellectual understanding.</span></div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">My first girlfriend in college suffered from menstrual cramps. The phrase "suffered from" has watered itself down over the ages to mean "influenced by". While my intention is not to exclude that interpretation, I must be explicit about the distinct imagery I hope to convey: When she had cramps, she&nbsp;<em style="box-sizing: border-box;">suffered</em>. This specific brand of suffering is an intense physical pain that leaves a person clenched in a ball, rolling on the floor, begging for deliverance.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">The first time I saw this my childish ignorance about menstruation was obliterated. This process was genuine, visceral, horrible, and routine. My childish attitude toward the "problem" has taken the intervening decades to correct. As an 18-year-old, I thought my job was to be company and support during these painful episodes. While some women may desire this of their friends and spouses, I've found (in my limited anecdotal experience) that most just want to be left alone until the feeling passes. The experience is physically unpleasant, the discomfort can be embarrassing, and little can be done about the situation but wait for it to resolve itself.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">Which brings us to the workday. If you are a man, or a woman who does not experience menstrual cramps, imagine fighting through a workday (or two) with a searing pain emanating from within the depths of your body. Now imagine that you are acutely aware of the source of pain but it's not a social norm to announce such sorts of things: if you want relief from this, your only option is a generic "sick day", which are doled out in finite number by your employer.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">Now imagine you are presented with this day of torture and this lose-lose decision&nbsp;<em style="box-sizing: border-box;">every month</em>.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">At <a href="http://www.nilenso.com/" target="_blank">nilenso</a> (and everywhere, I hope), the solution is clear. First, destroy any childish taboo or squeamishness about menstruation and menstrual cramps: this is simply a fact of life we must all be comfortable with given the limitations of our human biology. Then, dedicate optional days to this event every month. If someone sends a note in the morning: "I have cramps." the team knows she's unreachable for that day. That's it. No sick days, no fighting through a day of pain at the office, and no unnecessarily burdensome decision.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">We look forward to a day when this policy is so well understood and so commonplace it need not even be written down.

Menstruation is a known quantity: it is common to all pre-menopausal adult women and it occurs 13 times a year. As such, it should be addressed in isolation. To separate menstruation from health issues (migraines, flu, food poisoning, or any of the other issues which cause someone to take leave from work) demands that one's environment avoid conflating the two, implicitly or explicitly. This requires an explicit acceptance of the terms governing the policy.</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">Our policy is this: When you have cramps, send an email (or equivalent) notifying the team that "I have cramps." and then take the day off.<br /><br /><br /><b>Isn't this problem solved by unlimited sick leave?</b><br /><br />No, for two reasons. The first reason is straightforward: menstruation is not an illness. As mentioned above, it is a natural and cyclical (therefore, predicable) process.<br /><br />The second reason is somewhat nuanced but worth considering in its own right: policies on Sick Leave are not static. Nilenso's own policy on Sick Leave has changed drastically in recent years and our particular example is precisely why unlimited sick leave doesn't solve the problem in a satisfactory way. Last year, we eliminated unlimited sick leave. We still have unlimited sick leave for disability (say when someone is seriously injured or has Dengue Fever, which has happened) but for various reasons we now track sick days. If our menstruation policy and sick leave policy were conflated, eliminating unlimited sick leave would have had direct consequences on menstruation leave.</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><b>How do we get from "taboo" to "normal"?</b></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">We cheated.

Until then, however, we will lean on the #2 Rule in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" target="_blank">Zen of Python</a>:</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;"><b>"Explicit is better than implicit."</b></span><br /><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">There are a number of reasons for this. We do not want the guideline or policy to fall into question and administration of our business changes (nilenso is structured as a representative democracy and the administration is meant to change). Every employee should understand the terms of the agreement, since both a guideline and a policy are an agreement between the organization and its constituent members. An explicit written policy, in plain English, is easier to understand than a guideline.</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">Perhaps most importantly (since it is future-facing), a written policy forces changes to the policy to also be made explicitly. For example, it would be a disappointing regression of the policy indeed if we were to begin demanding proof of someone's menstrual cramps... but this has occurred in other corporations in other countries, which means it isn't unheard of. A written policy ensures such regressions (or any other change) is identified as an event in the common legal understanding between the employees of the company. Events future to these changes can then retrospect on the change and how/why it came about.</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><b>What about similar policies which have failed?</b></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">There are a number of articles (we won't link any here) which attack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_leave" target="_blank">menstrual leave</a>, citing examples in particular countries and companies across the globe. These policies have not always been successful and the failed installations often seem to be a product of sexism. However, where they have failed, such articles do not propose alternatives. The implicit alternative is to return to the consumption of sick leaves. The argument that menstrual leave exacerbates existing sexism in the workplace is weak, at best. "Existing sexism" is not a baby to be coddled nor a concept to keep safely hidden. There is sexism in every work space and for the infection to be removed it must be dug out. If your workplace or office does not already have frank, open discussions about the state of sexism, bigotry, racism, and zealotry in society, you might use menstrual leave as a conversation piece to get started.</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">Nilenso is far from perfect and our preferences, fears, and prejudices guide us as much as anyone else.

Thankfully, that conversation can be had in isolation. (A<span style="line-height: 25.6px;">nd it should be!) Migraines, diabetes, depression... there is a long list of physical and mental health issues which may affect your employees either periodically or repeatedly. However, none of these conditions is inherent to one's existence as a human being. Each of these illnesses is variously treatable, preventable, and/or curable.

It applies to billable hours, the review cycle, procurement, signing contracts... pretty much everything you can think of when running a business.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Rather than applying effort into making the employer-employee relationship a science with laser focus on detail, apply that same effort to trust.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>What if the policy is misused to someone's personal advantage?</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">We understand that this policy can be taken advantage of but this is true of every policy. Responding to abuse of any leave policy is orthogonal to the structure of the policy itself. For example, nilenso has a few other distinct leave policies:</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="line-height: 25.6px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><u>National holidays:</u> When we are legally obligated to close the office, everyone should notify their teams and clients.</span></span></li><li><span style="line-height: 25.6px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><u>Vacation:</u> Leave for vacation is requested of the team and client, with enough lead time to plan around the person's absence.</span></span></li><li><span style="line-height: 25.6px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><u>(Limited) Sick Leave:</u> Illness is hard to anticipate, so this usually comes as an email to the team that same morning.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><u>(Unlimited) Very Sick Leave:</u> Bangalore is subtropical, giving us both beautiful weather and exposure to very serious diseases. Dengue, for example, is very common and can put someone on extended leave for a month or more.</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Obviously, each type of leave is subject to a different kind of abuse. We trust everyone not to take sudden vacation without notice. We trust everyone to take sick days only when they feel genuinely unwell.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">When we have seen "abuse" of such policies at nilenso, it hasn't been a devious attempt to deceive the company for one's personal advantage. For those in managerial and administrative positions, conversations about abuse of the leave policy tend to be about excessive liberties taken. Some of these conversations can happen in a group, some are better one-on-one. In the case of a perceived abuse of menstrual leave, a female (for obvious reasons) senior staff member should approach the conversation with a curious and open mind. As before, if the environment is one of mutual trust this conversation shouldn't be difficult.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>What if I want to come to work?</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Of course! It's important that this policy remain <i>optional</i>. Not everyone experiences menstruation the same way. Some women we spoke to prefer to be at home during menstrual cramps. Others prefer to come to the office and work independently in a comfortable space. Some even have support groups who prepare food &amp; tea for anyone who is menstruating and give them a comfortable space while allowing them to be with other people. It is important to figure out what works for your company and for you as an individual.</span></div><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>I work at a large corporation and I'm skeptical of introducing such a policy.

Every organization is different and will require a slightly different approach. Even two organizations of comparable size may face drastically different challenges when implementing a policy like this. We talked about what this policy might look like in a larger organization and came up with three broad points to consider:</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 25.6px;"><u>Openness:</u> Not everyone needs to know about everyone else's leave. For something as personal as menstrual leave, every organization will need to consider the audience. Who needs to know? Your boss? Your team? HR? How comfortable are people in your organization with sharing such information, and how broadly?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 25.6px;"><u>Abuse:</u> We've covered this above but it's worth reiterating that we feel the only solution to preventing abuse is to grow trust within the hierarchy of your organization and between individuals.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 25.6px;"><u>Taboo:</u> Work continuously to dissolve the taboo.
